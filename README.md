# Mello

Mello is a project management tool designed to help individuals and teams organize their work, prioritize tasks, and collaborate effectively. The application is designed with a simple and intuitive interface that enables users to create and manage multiple boards, each with customizable lists and cards.

Mello's main interface consists of a board with multiple lists, and each list contains cards that represent individual tasks or projects. Users can create cards, add detailed descriptions, assign due dates, and assign labels to help organize their workflow. Cards can be moved between lists, providing a visual representation of progress.

Users can also assign tasks to team members and view progress updates in real-time. Mello's notifications system ensures that everyone is kept up-to-date with changes and updates to the board.
